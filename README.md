# HTML and CSS Example
This webpage is an example home page for an art production studio focused on the digital-art medium, pixels! 
It includes a basic home section with a navbar, gallery image containers with desciptions of services, and a contact form.


# Bootstrap Example
This website follows the same, previously-mentioned art production studio, this time with the webpage styled
using Bootstrap 4. It includes several Bootstrap components, including a navbar, jumbotron, cards, and a simple form.
